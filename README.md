Main products of the company:
KRYZA Network, KRYZA Exchange and KRYZA Vote.
At its core there is a social media platform (KRYZA Network), which is primarily aimed at educating its registrants and developing the crypto culture of its users.
Closely linked to the central social experience, there are two separate but connected platforms, KRYZA Exchange and KRYZA Vote.
KRYZA Vote is a voting platform where users of the site can collectively vote for projects to get listed on KRYZA Holding Ltd's independent cryptocurrency exchange, KRYZA Exchange.
KRYZA Exchange, like the largest exchanges, can handle multiple blockchains, be it ERC-20 or even BEP-20.
Other products of the company:
KRN Token, KRX Token, KRYZA VIP Holder system, a standalone blockchain under the KRYZA name and KRD Coin (KRYZA Diamond).
KRN Token: The KRYZA Network Token is the driving force of the community site and plays a number of roles in our system: in addition to basic exchange trading, it performs various donation and reward functions on KRYZA Network, and is also the cornerstone of the VIP Holder system. Future plans include integration into the Hungarian and then European cafeteria system.
KRX Token: The KRYZA Exchange Token is intended to reflect the market capitalisation of our cryptocurrency exchange, in addition to traditional exchange trading, acting as a kind of statement, and by holding the token, it can provide users with more favourable trading conditions.
VIP Holder System: Those who commit KRN tokens, get rewarded from the income of KRYZA Network ads platform, KRZYA Exchange transactions, and the reflections of trading KRN and KRX on any site. (KRN staking)

KRYZA Blockchain: Developing our own blockchain gives the opportunity to a number of new reachable functions and along with that it provides a greater quality of the existing products.
KRD Coin: KRYZA Blockchain's native cryptocurrency. It enables transactions through blockchains, making the flow of different currencies universal.

Our first two games are under constructions (an CCG like and an FPS like game) where you can earn KRN and KRX tokens and the theatre is the Metaversum
